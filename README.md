# Student Result Mnagement
 

The Student Result Management System is a Python-based application designed to help institutions manage student results efficiently. The system supports functionalities such as adding new results, searching for specific student records, viewing detailed reports, and role-based permissions for teachers and students. The project is built using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI and SQLite for database management. Additionally, it uses various other libraries for calculations, data manipulation, and visualization.


## Features

- Role-Based Access Control:

  Students can view their own results and update their information  but cannot delete records.

  Teachers can manage student records fully, including adding, updating, and deleting results.
- Student & Teacher Seperate Registration and Login
- Automatic Grade and CGPA Calculation:
   
   Based on the attendance and semester marks, the system automatically calculates the percentage, grade, and CGPA of the students.
- Search Functionality:

  Teachers can search for any studentâ€™s result by roll number.   Students can only search for their own results after logging in.
